## Topic : Admission committee
The university has a system for applying for studies at a particular faculty. The administrator registers applicants to the selected faculty. The system allows you to make everyone in a single base for choosing the best for admission.

## Vision
Create a web-application for working with applicants and assigning them a faculty in the system. The application must implement the next functions:
* view the list of applicants and edit them.
* show all applicants in system.
* view the list of faculties and the number of applicants in each of them.
